- Perform deposits and withdrawals.
- Check account balances.
- Maintain a transaction log.
- Persistent data storage using a relational database.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core programming language.
- **JDBC**: For database connectivity.
- **MySQL**: Relational database for storing account and transaction data.
